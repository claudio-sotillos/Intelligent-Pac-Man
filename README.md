# Intelligent-Pac-Man
Using Reinforcement Learning, we have taught a Pac-Man to eat all the Ghosts in a variety of Maps.
In order to solve this problem, we developed three main Agents (we call Agent to a set of instructions from which the PacMan learns from, for instance, the location of the nearest 
ghost). Each ghost learns certain features of the Map and uses this learning to eat the Ghosts.

# Usage Manual

In order to try each of the Agents, you will have to substitute the "bustersAgents.py" and the "qtable.txt" of the given Agent you want to use, by the same named files
inside the "pacman" folder. 
Once done this substitution with the files of the desired Agent, just run the "game.py" file and check how the agent eats ghosts alone.
